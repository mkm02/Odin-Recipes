            <li>½ head of cabbage</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots (<i>peeled and trimmed</i>)</li>
            <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>¼ cup apple cider vinegar</li>

        <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
        <h3 class="component">For the Pulled Pork</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spray inside of slow-cooker with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pour an inch of barbeque sauce into the bottom of the slow-cooker crock.</li>
            <li>Score the fat on top of the roast in a crisscross pattern, being sure to cut through the fat layer.</li>
            <li>Place the roast in the slow-cooker and pour 8 ounces of BBQ sauce over the roast.</li>
            <li>Place the onion wedges around the roast.</li>
            <li>Cover the slow-cooker with the lid. Set the temperature to HIGH and cook the roast (unopened) for 6 hours or until the meat can easily be pierced with a fork.</li>
            <li>Transfer the roast to a cutting board, remove the fat layer, and use two forks to pull it apart. Hence the name, <i>pulled pork</i>.</li>
            <li>Serve on buns and extra BBQ sauce or, if desired, place the pulled pork into a large bowl and mix it together with extra BBQ sauce to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve pulled pork with coleslaw on sandwich buns.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="component">For the Coleslaw</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the core and outer layers from the cabbage. Cut the cabbage into pieces sized to fit into a food processor. Grate the cabbage in the food processor or with a grater. 
                If no food processor is available, slice the cabbage very thin, and chop it until the pieces are very small.
            </li>
            <li>Grate the carrots the same size as the cabbage.</li>
            <li>Combine the grated cabbage and carrots and season with salt. Place the vegetables in a colander/strainer and set it over a large plate to drain for an hour.</li>
            <li>After an hour, squeeze the cabbage by twisting it in a clean dishtowel to remove as much moisture as possible.</li>
            <li>Combine the sugar and apple cider vinegar. Whisk together until sugar has dissolved. Add mayonnaise, celery seed, black pepper and chives. Whisk again, taste and adjust seasonings, if needed.</li>
            <li>Squeeze the cabbage again and add it to the dressing. Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Serve coleslaw with pulled pork on sandwich buns. Enjoy!</li>
